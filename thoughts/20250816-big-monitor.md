After more than 10 years of living happily inside the JetBrains Toolbox, I’m switching things up. For the next two months, I’ll be writing code exclusively in Cursor/VSCode. Why? For two reasons: 

* I really want to give Cursor a fair and honest kick at the tires
* and to a lesser because I invested in a 49-inch monitor
* (bonus reason) are cloud-based dev environments ready to fully support my day-to-day

I’ve leaned on Jetbrains' IntelliJ IDEA and Pycharm batteries-included ecosystems for a long time and I’m curious to see how well Cursor (vs Pycharm + Copilot) can streamline my day-to-day dev workflow. Additionally, my 49-inch monitor investment has had the unintended consequence of making my screen exceptionally hard to share on name-your-favourite-video-conferencing platform. What I tend to do now is share my browser and because most of my goto-tools are cloud-based: Postman, Lucidchart, Mermaid, GitHub, AWS etc. Github Codespaces has been very helpful.

> This isn’t about loyalty to one editor over another — it’s about testing whether cloud dev environments are ready to fully support the kind of work I do every day.

And to my friends in the other camps — yes, I see you emacs [Trevor Bernard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorbernard/) and vim [Saša Savić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/onesale/) fanboys. I’ve only got two months and can’t spend six of them tweaking keybindings and configuration files 🫶.
